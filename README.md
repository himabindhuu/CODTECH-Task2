## Overview Of The Project

### Project:Deep learning for image recognition

## Objective
Creating a deep learning model for image recognition tasks using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Preprocessing image data, augment
the dataset to increase diversity, and design a CNN architecture with
multiple layers. Training the
model on a large dataset and employing
techniques like transfer learning with pretrained models for improved performance.
## Key Activities
-Data Cleaning : Ensuring the dataset is free fron inconviencies and missing values.

-Data Visualisation : Creating visualisation to understand data distribution,trends and relationships.
By using cnn i have made a model where it recognises a given image after it has been trained on huge dataset.
